                <h1>What is bash, and what do I need it for?</h1>

                <p>Welcome to the bash guide.  You're reading this guide, which means you probably have a vague idea about what bash is and what you might want to do with it.</p>
                
                <p>If you've already got a fair notion of what bash is, I'd like to advise you to try and forget everything you think you know before you continue.  There is a dreadful amount of misinformation floating around with regards to bash, its syntax and its place in your computer system.  This guide will be maximally effective if you reset that prior knowledge and begin a clean slate.</p>

                <h2>So what <em>is</em> bash?</h2>

                <p>Short answer: Bash is a program on your computer like any other, but designed to be easy for you to talk to.</p>

                <p>Every program on your computer has the ability to do a vast amount of different things.  Read files, start other programs, do math, control devices.  The main difference between bash and most other programs is that unlike them, bash was not programmed to perform a certain task.  Bash was programmed to take commands from you, the user.  To do so efficiently, a "language" was created which allows users to "speak" to the bash program and tell it what to do.  This language is
                the bash shell language and you are about to become intimately familiar with it.</p>

                    So bash is a program that listens to me and does what I tell it to.

                <h2>What do I do with it?</h2>

                <p>Most of you will have quite a bit of experience already using computers.  You probably use your keyboard and your mouse to interact with various programs on your computer.  Most likely, you do this in a visual interface composed of buttons and widgets, text fields and images.  This is the graphical user interface that has become the centerpiece to most users' computer interaction.</p>

                <p>There are other ways of interacting with your computer, though.  Bash uses a method directly counter to the ideas of graphical user interfaces: it runs in a text-only "console" where interaction is mainly limited to displaying characters on your screen and reading them from your keyboard.  If you're not yet familiar in this kind of environment, it will feel exceptionally alien, primitive and limiting to you.</p>

                <p>The truth is in fact quite the opposite.  While a text-only interface is certainly less potent in what it can display (it's certainly not well suited for displaying images), its simplicity makes it very easy for us as humans to find consistent structure in how we can interprete the text that appears in it and how we can issue our commands.  You'll find that the most skilled computer users are wildly more efficient in performing tasks through a text-based interface than
                performing the same tasks using programs with a graphical interface.  You will soon learn that the simplicity of bash's shell language is a key element to this.</p>

                <p>So, what do you do with bash?  You will use it to find out what files are on your computer, and what is in them.  You will use it to run programs that can make all sorts of changes to your computer, from editing files and images to converting them.  From moving and copying files around to creating automatic back-ups.  From downloading code of new programs to compiling and running them.  But before you get too excited: it is key that you remember, <strong>bash is a
                    tool</strong>, a single tool in a huge toolbox of programs.  Bash alone will only let you do basic things with files and other programs.  You will need to understand all the other tools in the toolbox of your system.  This knowledge is vast and will come slowly, it is important that you <strong>take the time to learn them well</strong> rather than try to get the basic idea of most and break a leg tomorrow (or more likely, your music archive or collection of family
                pictures).</p>
