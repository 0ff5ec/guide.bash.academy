some topics that come up in questions and need to be explained well:
- quoting
- different kinds of tests, different kinds of patterns
- env, global and local vars, scoping
- parsing "layers": what is bash syntax, what is command arguments and data/ literal vs. syntactical etc.

"exercises for the reader"?
